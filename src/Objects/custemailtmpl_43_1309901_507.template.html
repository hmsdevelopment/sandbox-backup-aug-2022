${partner.firstName},
<p>For some time now we have been offering the option for your sales counselors to receive email notifications for any showings or inquiries HMS receives for their properties. It&#39;s been pretty successful so far, but we&#39;re always looking to make the process of distributing leads easier for everyone. So now we are offering text/SMS notifications for those who don&#39;t have access to email away from a computer. Today we sent an email to your sales counselors giving them the option to opt-in to text/SMS messaging. If they do opt-in they will get the following message when a new showing or inquiry is received:<br />
<br />
<em>From HMS: We&#39;ve sent an inquiry to [their email address]</em><your address="" email="" your=""><em>. If you&#39;d like phone confirmation call us at 855-467-2255.</em><br />
<br />
This allows them to accept the lead via email if convenient, or call us directly for the information if not. Either way they have easy access and reduced incoming phone calls if they want. It&#39;s the first step in our goal of offering two way text/SMS communications where sales counselors will be able to accept inquiries from text messages.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you,</your></p>
