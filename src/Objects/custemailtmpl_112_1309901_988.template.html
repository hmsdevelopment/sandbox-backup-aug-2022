<span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Dear ${customrecord.custrecord_real_estate_agent_name.custrecord_agent_first_name},<br />
<br />
Congratulations on your recent (or maybe not quite so recent?) sale at ${customrecord.custrecord_house_number} ${customrecord.custrecord31}, in ${customrecord.custrecordcustrecordsubdname.custrecord_subdivision_id}, lot ${customrecord.custrecord_lot_number}, built by ${customrecord.custrecord_top_level_builder}.<br />
<br />
We will be entering the details of this transaction into the&nbsp;${customrecord.custrecord15.custrecord_known_as} on your behalf to properly recognize your recent sales success at the request of ${customrecord.custrecord_top_level_builder}. This entry into the&nbsp;${customrecord.custrecord15.custrecord_known_as} will serve to support and promote the values of this outstanding community and your clients&#39; investment. Appraisers appreciate the ${customrecord.custrecord15.custrecord_known_as} as a good source for the information they need to complete their work on new construction appraisals.<br />
<br />
As is our custom, and in order to comply with the guidelines of the ${customrecord.custrecord15.custrecord_known_as}, we might need to modify some of the dates and details that we report as part of this process. As one example, since we cannot enter a &ldquo;Sold Date&rdquo; that is any earlier than the &ldquo;Listing Date&rdquo;, and since the property will just now be entered into the ${customrecord.custrecord15.custrecord_known_as} within the next few days we will enter the contract accepted date (and possibly the SOLD date) as being the same date after the listing date. The actual &quot;PENDING&quot; and the &quot;SOLD&quot; dates will be entered in the agent remarks section of the ${customrecord.custrecord15.custrecord_known_as}, if they are not entered accurately into the ${customrecord.custrecord15.custrecord_known_as}.</span></span>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12px;"> Should you have any questions or concerns about this practice or the entry of the property into the ${customrecord.custrecord15.custrecord_known_as} in general, please contact me directly on my cell at 513-518-6190.<br />
<br />
Unless we hear guidance to the contrary from you, we will proceed with this entry within the next few working days.<br />
<br />
Once again, congratulations on a most professional job.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the opportunity to be of service.</span></span><br />
