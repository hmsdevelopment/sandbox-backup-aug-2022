Helping you to sell even more new homes, HMS is enabling a service for your division, Agent Feedback Surveys. This service is intended to facilitate new home sales and to help forge your relationship with the most productive real estate agents in the area.

Each time a scheduled appointment has been completed we will send a survey to the showing agent asking for feedback about that showing and the property that was shown. The agent will be asked to participate in a survey of quick, targeted questions the same day of the showing. Upon completion of that survey the results are emailed directly to you, to management, as well as to anyone else in the organization management would like to include. Your review of these results may yield very meaningful insights into the interest level of the buyer and possibly alert you to sales opportunities that were not obvious at the time of the appointment.

If the agent does not respond to our initial request then a second request is sent on day two following the showing. A third request is sent on day three following the showing. After the third request produces no response we will then send you an update to indicate that they were not responsive and no more requests will be made for that showing.

As you should be aware, HMS leaves confirmation of appointments up to you, we donâ€™t confirm appointments with agents. At the end of the scheduled showing time we will:

Ask you to confirm that the showing has successfully taken place as scheduled. An affirmative response to that question kicks off the feedback survey process. If the original appointment has been changed then we ask that you provide us with the rescheduled time and date. The confirmation process will again take place at the conclusion of that adjusted time and with an affirmative response the survey process is initiated.

We are excited about the opportunity to expand our services to your organization and hope that you find significant value in this new offering. We are confident that it will prove to be a real asset to your operations and welcome any feedback that might help to improve the offering.

Thank you in advance for your patience, understanding and continued support,

Your Friends at HMS!
