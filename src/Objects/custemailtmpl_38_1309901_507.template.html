${partner.firstName},
<p>Starting October 1st HMS will begin processing leads that originate from Fischer Homes&rsquo; website. Our process will be similar to how we handle phone leads. An email will go to the sales counselor and a separate email will go to the sales manager as well as any other management personnel who wish to receive them. By default only the sales manager and the sales counselor assigned to a given web lead will receive these emails. If you wish to receive them please <a href="https://1309901.extforms.netsuite.com/app/site/hosting/scriptlet.nl?script=138&amp;deploy=1&amp;compid=1309901&amp;h=aa45d85b979fd310fc65&amp;id=${partner.id}">please click here</a> and you will be added to the distribution. Please note: Whether you have or have not been getting emails for non-website leads in the past, clicking the above link will not change that.</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>
