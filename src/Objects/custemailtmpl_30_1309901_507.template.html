<p class="MsoNormal">We&rsquo;re excited to announce new enhancements to our property inquiry process. When we receive an inquiry at HMS - be it a showing, appraisal, inspection, or simply property questions - about one of your listings a Real Time Automated Notification will be emailed to the Sales Counselor and to the Sales Manager along with other interested parties.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>What this means for Sales Counselors:</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This email contains three links for the Sales Counselor to choose from.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The first, &ldquo;I will Follow Up with the Real Estate Agent&rdquo; tells HMS that you have received the property inquiry and that you intend to follow up with the agent (or inspector, or appraiser, or individual). From our perspective at HMS it tells us that the call is closed and we don&rsquo;t need to follow up any further. This allows appointment setting to be a more streamlined process. Now the moment we receive an inquiry you&rsquo;ll have all the caller and property information at your fingertips. And you won&rsquo;t have to worry about a phone call from HMS while meeting with a client! Just be sure to notify us that you will indeed follow up with the caller (via this first link) otherwise if it gets close to the scheduled showing time we will follow up with you by phone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The second, &ldquo;Change Sales Counselor&rdquo; allows you to reassign an inquiry to a different Sales Counselor. This is especially useful for real estate agents that may already be registered with another Sales Counselor. Once reassigned an email will go to you, the newly assigned Sales Counselor and the Sales Manager with all the call details.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Finally, there is, &ldquo;Request Phone Follow-up&rdquo; if you&rsquo;d prefer to speak with the HMS staff about the inquiry being referenced*.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>What this means for Sales Managers:</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The email version that is directed to the Sales Manager (along with other interested parties) is an abbreviated version of the above. It provides the pertinent information regarding the inquiry and also allows for the sales person to be reassigned with one click. This notice is now coming to the Sales Manager at the very earliest stage of the appointment process. In the past the notice was directed to the sales manager after the sales person was already contacted. Now if a reassignment is necessary it can be implemented before the first sales counselor has made contact with the interested party. This feature should help to catch those assignments that are misdirected for whatever reason before the process is too far along. In addition, the sales person version is asking that first sales person to confirm that they are the correct person to be working that lead for that property on that day. If that is not the case the salesperson is also afforded an quick and easy opportunity to reassign the lead.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Anytime that a lead is reassigned please understand that all the affected parties are notified of the change automatically.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>What this means for Division Coordinators:</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Calls from Appraisers and Home Inspectors will now be directed to the Division Coordinators utilizing this method.&nbsp; In the prior overview for Sales Counselors please make the appropriate changes in terminology but the explanation of the functionality remains the same for an appraisal or inspector call.&nbsp; Please just click the link to indicate that you will follow up with that party or request Follow up by phone from HMS.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Of course if you have any questions about an inquiry or this process do give us a call.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">These new enhancements are now active, so look for your first Real Time Automated Notification in your inbox soon. And if you have any feedback, we&rsquo;d love to hear from you. By email or by phone!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">One last thing to note is that the emails to Sales Counselors and Division Coordinators will go out on a regular basis until one of the three links is clicked&nbsp; and (in the case of changing the sales counselor) the appropriate fields are filled out.</p>
