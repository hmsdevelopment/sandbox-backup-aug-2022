We&#39;d like to take this opportunity to let you update your communication preferences with HMS to enable 2 way texting. If enabled you will be able to confirm your showings via text by simply replying &#39;Y&#39; to the text we send you. To make this work, we&#39;ve added information to the texts we send. You&#39;ll now get property, agent, and showing information. And since the number of characters that can be sent in a single text is limited to 160 we&#39;ll also still send the emails you&#39;re used to.&nbsp;
<p><your address="" email="" your=""><br />
We hope this will make your life just a little bit easier by removing the need to hunt down an email to confirm a showing, while still giving you the option to use the emails to get the details that may be lacking in a text message.<br />
<br />

<br />
If you choose to enable 2 Way Texting, all you need to do when you get a text from us is to reply &quot;Y&quot; (without quotes) to confirm the showing with HMS.<br />
<br />
Please note that changing the&nbsp;sales counselor assigned to a showing will still require using the link embedded in the emails.</your></p>

<p>Thank you,</p>
