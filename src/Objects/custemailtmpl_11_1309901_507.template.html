We call this service our “Feedback Survey” and we believe that it holds the promise of helping you to make more sales and to make more sales more profitably.</span></font><br><font face="Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11px;"></span></font><br><font face="Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11px;">How it works:&nbsp;</span></font><br><font face="Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11px;"></span></font><br><font face="Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11px;">Each time a scheduled showing comes to its conclusion a confirming email will be generated to the responsible sales person for the builder asking a few questions and asking to confirm that the showing took place as scheduled. Once we have confirmation the showing appointment did take place an email is generated to the showing real estate agent asking a few questions and soliciting feedback on the property. As soon as the agent answers the questions and submits the answers they are sent directly to the responsible sales person for the builder and they are copied to whomever the builder would like to receive these survey answers. Typically this might include the sales manager and possibly the division manager. Some builders also ask that additional support personnel be included in the distribution list.</span></font><br><font face="Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11px;"></span></font><br><font face="Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11px;">If the appointment has been rescheduled from the original date and time that we had originally booked then the builder’s sales person is prompted to provide us with that new appointment information. The cycle noted above then plays out again at the conclusion of that new time and date. If the appointment has been cancelled or did not happen then this process will stop upon that feedback.</span></font><br><font face="Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11px;"></span></font><br><font face="Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11px;">We will continue to send requests for feedback to the showing agent on successive days until we receive the feedback. After day three no more requests will be made of that agent and their failure to respond will be noted to everyone on the distribution list. We have found in beta testing that we typically will get a response on day two if a response is to be forthcoming at all.</span></font><br><font face="Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11px;"></span></font><br><font face="Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11px;">After you receive the survey results review the answers and react accordingly. We have found that sometimes there is much more interest than was originally demonstrated during the showing and have also found that quick follow up with the showing agent can yield positive results and can even lead to sales that might not have been initially obvious.</span></font><br><font face="Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11px;"></span></font><br><font face="Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11px;">From managements’ perspective timely, consistent and unfiltered feedback can provide valuable insights into the perspective of those prospects and agents who are showing your inventory. Considering the responses on a given property over time might provide keys to adjustments that help to sell the home more quickly.</span></font><br><font face="Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11px;"></span></font><br><font face="Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11px;">We are excited about the opportunity to expand our services to your organization and hope that you find significant value in this new offering. We are confident that it will prove to be a real asset to your operations and welcome any feedback that might help to improve the offering.</span></font><br><font face="Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11px;"></span></font><br><font face="Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11px;">Thank you for the continued opportunity to be of service.</span></font><br><font face="Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11px;"></span></font><br><font face="Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11px;"><b>Al Hencheck, Jr.</b></span></font><br><font face="Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11px;"><b><br></b></span></font><font face="Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11px;"><b>On behalf of the entire HMS Marketing Services Team</b></span></font><br><div style="font-family: Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 8pt; "></div>
